This is a simple CRUD application developed while studying for Zend PHP Certification. 

* Please view erd.png in the root directory for the planned database structure. 

Current Functionality - 

*Homepage*
Creates 'agents' via 'Agents Sign up Here'.
Uses MySQL COUNT to show quantity of Agents in the Database. 
Displays each 'agents' name and date registered.

*Admin*
Allows user to Edit, Delete and view information about each 'agent'.

*Change Agent Password*
Allows password change.

*Login/Logout*
Created functionality using SESSION.


Future Plans - 

My study of Objective-C, JavaScript and Ruby has given me an appreciation for Object Oriented Programming. Currently, this PHP code is using Procedural programming but I am in the process of learning and updating to OOP.

I will use a framework, ZEND Framework 2.0, to update the codebase.

An email module will be added

*Buyers*
The next step is for each 'agent' to create 'buyers' in the system. The index page will have a search module and results will paginate.
